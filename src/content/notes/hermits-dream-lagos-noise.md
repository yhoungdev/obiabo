# Notes from Ajah

It’s 18:58 on Friday, November 28, 2025. I’m sitting at an eatery in Ajah (Lagos Island) with an Aquafina water bottle, my Oraimo AirPods, and my glasses in front of me, typing on a 14” MacBook M2 Pro.

<br/>

It’s been a tough year for me. Today I watched Ozark on Netflix, slept, woke up, and still feel like nothing matters. I scrolled Twitter, jumped on Bluesky, Lobste.rs, and Bear Blog, talked about DNA editing and DNA as storage, and still nothing entices me. The Sheik of light has kept the light off for the past seven hours, and I’m sick and tired of it. I need freedom from the noise. I want a cool space to read. I want my own space to dive back into Linux and distro hubs like I did as a teenager. I’ll be twenty something again next month, December, and I can hardly believe the age I’m becoming.


</br>


2025 has been rough. I don’t like writing TypeScript, but I’ve had to continue because it puts food on the table for now. I’m looking for better opportunities. I love systems programming. I have this big Rust book, but I still need to get an apartment. A Lagos landlord showed me what Yoruba people call ata rodo, which ironically is the name of one of my projects. I hate it here.

I just want to read more, research Linux, systems, blockchains, the universe, hit the gym, and run like I used to.

<br>

My brain is running a race condition. I’ve never been so indecisive. I haven’t seen my lovely sister in a long while, and I’d love to see her. It’s 19:07 PM, and my account balance isn’t encouraging at all. I have more GitHub tiles than someone who works at GitHub, and yet my finances aren’t worth writing about. I don’t even have a girlfriend, because I need to stop this race condition first. I’ve seen many beautiful women on earth. I rarely go out, but each time I do, I see beauty. Truly, God is the greatest artist, the creator of the universe, whose work is a masterpiece beyond Shakespeare, Picasso, Dalí, Michelangelo, and others.

<br>

I have 15k+ followers on LinkedIn, yet I don’t use the app enough. That’s 15k on LinkedIn and 1.12k followers on Twitter. Meanwhile, in real life, I don’t have 1% of that number as friends. I don’t know if I’m an introvert. I haven’t seen my cat in a long while. I’m sorry, June. I failed you, and I blame myself each day for that.

I’m currently listening to “Goodness of God” by Bethel Worship and Jen Johnson. One thing I’ve missed is drumming. I need to go back to it, but I need stability first. They say money doesn’t buy happiness, but it buys a glimpse. It gives you confidence. It boosts it.

I hate it when people call me. The only voice I love to hear when I pick up is my lovely sister’s. Dear Janet, I promise you’ll read this one day.

This is me just yapping, and I don’t even know what I’m yapping about. Obsidian says this is 3,017 characters up to this point.

I want to live like a hermit with a big check solitude, reading, studying math, physics, computers, Bitcoin, and programming and hitting the gym like I’m training for the Olympics.

<br>

I have a free form hairstyle and sometimes it makes me look like a retarded Ratatouille, and when I work, people tend to look at me. Many compliment it. Ladies stare sometimes, and guys ask how I made my hair this way. I just let it grow.

I get overexcited when I take cappuccino or Latte, so I take them sometimes but not always.

I’ve done many things for education and fun. I tried running a Bitcoin node on a beat up Raspberry Pi 4 running Umbrel OS, with a 500GB HDD slow to write and a crappy Glo network. In my teenage years, I used to mod .jar apps. Some years back, I visited the dark web to solve CAPTCHAs. I’ve been a fan of the Onion routing network for a long time. I once tried running a relay. I also visited the dark web with a dedicated Linux distro called Tails OS.

2025 has been one of the craziest years of my two decades plus of living on this beautiful earth God created, but thank God Almighty for life, family, people around me, and open source.

I live in a third world country where nothing seems to matter to the indecisive imbeciles we have as government, whose morals are banged up and who only prioritize misplaced priorities.

I am currently listening to Dylan Owen while typing this part. I can talk about many things like I am a polymath. I love to learn and read, and I am thirsty for knowledge like a monk. Two days ago, I tried joining a book club that a pretty lady invited me to at the café after some hours of taking espresso. There are many beautiful minds there, but I’m not sure I’ll join them next time. Let’s see how it goes.

You want to talk We can talk about Linux, operating systems, and open source. Please don’t call me for equity without monetary compensation at the moment, because it would be a total debacle for my financial status right now.

This is not a memoir, neither is it a eulogy, and when I am balanced I will read more of Jorge Luis Borges’ masterpieces something like The Garden of Forking Paths.

I need a good job to be balanced and to get a conducive place, but I believe and trust in God that a new, good job is knocking at the door. If you have gotten to this point, thanks a lot for reading 4k+ characters and 900+ words from someone just yapping.

I’ll continue yapping later when my brain runs another race condition.
