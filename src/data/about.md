I’m a software engineer passionate about Linux, open-source ecosystems, and systems engineering. I build software ranging from developer tools to real-world applications and enjoy exploring systems that run close to the metal.

<br/>

I have solid experience with Linux and its various distributions, including Ubuntu, Kali Linux, Tails OS, Parrot OS, and Kubuntu. A few years ago, I experimented with running a Bitcoin node and personal server on a Raspberry Pi 4, but it didn’t go as planned due to hardware limitations, something I’d love to revisit in the future with better hardware.

<br/>

I was a Solana Summer Fellow '24 and continue to work on decentralized applications and blockchain systems.

<br/>

Recent projects include the <a class='text-default font-semibold' href="https://docs.useplunk.com/guides/rust-sdk">Plunk Rust SDK</a>, now the official community SDK, and an unofficial SDK for <a class='text-default font-semibold' href="https://polar.sh/">Polar.sh</a>.

<br/>

Currently, I'm building <a class="text-default font-semibold" href="https://www.ourpocket.xyz/">OurPocket</a> - an infrastructure API that enables B2B platforms to manage wallets across multiple payment and crypto providers through a single, secure integration.

<br/>

Outside of development, I play drums and enjoy diving into technical reads. Over time, I’ve curated an awesome reading list from some amazing corners of the web, think of it as a gold mine of knowledge you can explore <a class="text-default font-semibold underline" href="https://sudowhoami.notion.site/Some-Good-Reads-in-no-particular-order-25a13d4f6e9a80c88637e0b72955c0d8?pvs=74"> here </a>
. I’ve also got a few titles lined up on my personal reading list, including Mastering Bitcoin, <a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Forking_Paths"> The Garden of Forking Paths  </a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation" class="text-default">Many worlds interpretation</a>, <a class="text-default" href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters</a>, and <a class="text-default" href="https://archive.org/details/cu31924028741175"> The Dual Mandate in British Tropical Africa (1922) by Lord Frederick Lugard </a>.
