I’m just a guy who sits in front of a [*mini-LED* screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-LED) nearly every day, staring at a dark theme and filling blank spaces with combinations of letters (`A–Z`, `a–z`) and numbers, with a strong interest in [**Linux**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software), and [low-level systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language). Outside of all that, I play **drums** and occasionally dive into random deep reads.

Talking Linux? My main distro was [`Ubuntu`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu), but I’ve hopped through [*Kali Linux*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Linux), [**Parrot OS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot_OS), [`Lubuntu`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubuntu), and [`Tails`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tails_(operating_system)) (yes, I’m a hopper). And sure, I say I’m “trying” [**Arch Linux**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Linux), but let’s be real, I’m typing this on [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) ( Its batterybattery 🔋 life won my heart) 😅. Lately, I’ve been exploring [`Rust`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)) 🦀 and once ran a [*Bitcoin*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) node on a [Raspberry Pi 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi), just for the thrill of it ( Did'nt turned out great tho).

I was among the [*Solana Summer Fellows '24*](https://solana.com/grants#summer-camp), I’ve built on the [Solana blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solana_(blockchain_platform)) and remain deeply interested in all things decentralized.
