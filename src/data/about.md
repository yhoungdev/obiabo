### Whoami ðŸ‘‹

<br>

I'm a passionate **Software Engineer** with some knowledge of **mobile hardware engineering** and a love for all things **computers**. Outside of coding, I enjoy **drumming**, **research**, and exploring the intersection of **software and hardware technologies**.

<br>

I'm a huge **Linux** and **open-source** fan. Over my 4 years of using Linux, I've explored distros like **Ubuntu**, **Kali Linux**, **TailsOS**, and **ParrotOS**. Currently, Iâ€™m gearing up to test **Arch Linux**.

<br>

My technical interests include **low-level programming** (currently learning `Rust` ), **Networking**, and **Distributed Systems**. Iâ€™ve even tried running a **Bitcoin node** with **Umbrel** and a **Respberry PI 4**.

<br>

When it comes to the **Blockchain ecosystem**, I am particularly interested in **Bitcoin** and **Solana** (yes i know blockchain is not only all about that). I have built projects on the **Solana** blockchain as a **Solana Summer Fellow '24**.

<br>

Iâ€™m currently open to new opportunities and challenges.
