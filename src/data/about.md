### About Me

<br>

I'm a passionate **Software Engineer** obsessed with all things **computers**. Outside of coding, I enjoy **drumming** and **research**.

I'm a huge **Linux** and **open-source** fan. Over 4 years, I've explored distros like **Ubuntu**, **Kali Linux**, **TailsOS**, and **ParrotOS**. Currently, I’m gearing up to test **Arch Linux**.

<br>

My technical interests include **low-level programming** (currently learning ``` Rust ``` ), **Networking**, and **Distributed Systems**. I’ve even run a **Bitcoin node** with **Umbrel** and built projects on the **Solana** blockchain as a **Solana Summer Fellow '24**.

<br>

I’m always open to new opportunities and challenges.
