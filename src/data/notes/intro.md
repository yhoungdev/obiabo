Hooo Hooo Hooo, Welcome 👋 to the bright side of my internet! This is one thing even a black hole 🕳️ can’t absorb or draw in 😂. Now i and [[Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking)] needs to have a talk 😂

<br>

*This place is*

- 📝 A cozy little nook for my notes.
- 💭 A haven of thoughts, trials, and anecdotes.
- 🔍 A space to scribble the things I’ve tried and would like to try.
- ✨ A digital diary where curiosity resides.
- 📖 If I were to see this as a place in the Bible, it would be the book of **PROVERBS**, **PSALMS**, and **SONGS OF SOLOMON** (Because why? Knowledge,  OT, and my funny thoughts go deflow like Lagos flood 🌊).

<br>

*Feel free to explore, engage, and maybe even learn something along the way! ( No time ⏱️ to de check time ⏱️ and gbezome at the same time)*

<br>

Here are some of the notes I’m working on – brace yourself for the adventure (Drink some cup of water, breathe in, breathe out  and do the chills 😉. Take in some oxygen, breathe out carbon dioxide):

<br>

*Coming Soon 🚀 (Lets go to the Moon )*

<br>

- **How I tried running a Bitcoin node and personal server on a Raspberry Pi4**  
  *What happened, what went wrong, and why I’m still here*.

  <br>
  
- **What is Nostr and why do Bitcoiners say it is decentralized?**  
 *Spoiler alert – it’s not your average social network*.

 <br>

 - **Do i write codes ? YES, Do i trust machines ? NO**

 *Up to this blessed day, I’m still afraid of elevators (yes, trust issues 😂). It’s where gravity and my nerves have a serious chat, and my intrusive thoughts might win for a moment 😂. Claustrophobic? That’s a question in an infinite loop. But well it is what it is.*

 <br>

- **My primary work machine now is a Mac**  
  *I’ve been using Linux for 4 years, so why do I still prefer Linux over Mac?*

  <br>

- **Linux Distros I’ve Hopped On and Tried**  
  *A collection of my distro-hopping escapades – some love it, some… not so much.*

  <br>

- **If I had the chance, would I like to write a simple firmware with Rust to flex my muscles and learn?**  
  *Hell YES – because who doesn’t want to write low-level code and feel like  ([Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds))  or ([ Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto)) ?*

<br>

*Stay cheesed up for this, drink some cup of water 🚰 and do the calms*
