I'm a software engineer passionate about Linux, open-source ecosystems, and systems engineering. I build software ranging from developer tools to real-world applications and enjoy exploring systems that run close to the metal. Outside of code, I play **drums** 🥁 and occasionally dive into deep reads 📚.

<br/>

Recently, I worked on the <a class='text-default' href="https://crates.io/crates/plunk"> Plunk Rust SDK </a> 🦀  now the official community SDK featured in
<a class='text-default' href="https://docs.useplunk.com/guides/rust-sdk"> Plunk's documentation </a>. I’m also building an unofficial SDK for <a class='text-default' href='https://polar.sh' > Polar.sh </a> ❄️, both aimed at improving the open-source dev experience.

<br/>


And also, I am currently building <a class='text-default' href="https://www.ourpocket.xyz/">OurPocket</a>
