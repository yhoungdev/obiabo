I'm just a guy who sits in front of a [*mini-LED* screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-LED) nearly every day, staring at a dark theme and filling blank spaces with combinations of letters (`Aâ€“Z`, `aâ€“z`) and numbers, with a strong interest in [**Linux**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software), and [low-level systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language). Outside of all that, I play **drums** and occasionally dive into random deep reads.

*Currently, Iâ€™m open to new opportunities ðŸ’¼ and collaborations. If you're looking to work with someone passionate about technology and innovation, feel free to [reach out](https://x.com/obiabo_immanuel)*
